        <section name="Log4j 2.0 Guide">

            <p>
              Log4Jj 2.0 is an upgrade to Log4j that provides significant improvements over its predecessor, Log4j
              1.x, and provides many of the improvements available in Logback while fixing some inherent problems in
              Logback's architecture.
            </p>

            <p>Some of the features and improvements in Log4j 2.0 are:</p>

            <h3>API Separation</h3>
            <p>
              The API for Log4j is separate from the implementation. It is now clear to application developers
              what classes and methods they can use with compatibility being assured while allowing
              improvements to be made to the implementation.
            </p>
            <h3>Faster Implementation</h3>
            <p>
              Faster implementation than Log4j 1.x in critical areas and similar performance to Logback in
              most circumstances.
            </p>
            <h3>Support for multiple APIs</h3>
            <p>
              While the Log4j 2.0 API will provide the best performance, support for the SL4J and Commons Logging
              APIs are provided.
            </p>
            <h3>Automatic Reloading of Configurations</h3>
            <p>
              Like Logback, Log4j 2.0 can automatically reload its configuration upon modification. Unlike Logback,
              it will do so without losing log events while reconfiguration is taking place.
            </p>
            <h3>Advanced Filtering</h3>
            <p>
              Like Logback, Log4j 2.0 supports filtering based on context data, markers, regular expressions and
              other components in the Log event and can be specified to apply to all events before being passed
              to Loggers or as they pass through appenders. In addition, filters can also be associated with
              Loggers. Unlike Logback, a common Filter class can be used in any of these circumstances.
            </p>
            <h3>Plugin Architecture</h3>
            <p>
              All components that can be configured are defined as Log4j plugins. As such, no Log4j code must
              be changed to create a new Appender, Layout, Pattern Converter, etc. Log4j will automatically
              recognize properly defined plugins and use them when they are referenced in the configuration.
            </p>

        <section name="Requirements">
           <p>
             Log4j 2.0 requires Java 5. Some features may require optional dependencies. These dependencies are
             specified in the documentation for those features.
          </p>

        <section name="News">
          <p>
            Log4j 2.0 is now available. The API for Log4j 2.0 is not compatible with Log4j 1.x, however an adapter
            is
