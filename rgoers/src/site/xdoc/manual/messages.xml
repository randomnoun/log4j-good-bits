      <subsection name="Introduction">
        <p>
          Although Log4j 2 provides Logger methods that accept Strings and Objects, all of these are ulitmately
          captured in Message objects that are then associated with the log event. Applications are free to
          construct Messages of their own and pass them to the Logger. Although it may seem more expensive than
          passing the message format and parameters directly to the event, testing has shown that with modern
          JVMs the cost of creating and destroying events is minor, especially when complex tasks are encapsulated
          in the Message instead of the application. In addition, when using the methods that accept Strings and
          parameters, the underlying Message object will only be created if any configured global filters
          or the Logger's log level allow the message to be processed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider an application that has a Map object containing {"Name" = "John Doe", "Address" = "123 Main
          St.",
          "Phone" = "(999) 555-1212"} and a User object that has a getId method that returns "jdoe". The developer
          would like to add an informational message that returns "User John Doe has logged in using id jdoe". The
          way this could be accomplished is by doing:
        </p>
        <pre>
          logger.info("User {} has logged in using id {}, map.get("Name"), user.getId());
        </pre>
        <p>
          While there is nothing inherently wrong with this, as the complexity of the objects and desired output
          increases this technique becomes harder to use. As an alternative, using Messages allows:
        </p>
        <pre>
          logger.info(new LoggedInMessage(map, user));
        </pre>
        <p>
          In this alternative the formatting is delegated to the LoggedInMessage object's getFormattedMessage
          method.
          Although in this alternative a new object is created, none of the methods on the objects passed to the
          LoggedInMessage are invoked until the LoggedInMessage is formatted. This is especially useful when an
          Object's toString method does not produce the information you would like to appear in the log.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another advantage to Messages is that they simplify writing Layouts. In other logging frameworks the
          Layout must loop through the parameters individually and determine what to do based on what objects
          are encountered. With Messages the Layout has the option of delegating the formatting to the Message or
          performing its formatting based on the type of Message encountered.
        </p>

      </subsection>
      <a name="FormattedMessage"/>
      <subsection name="FormattedMessage">
        <p>
          A FormattedMessage will have setFormat and getFormat methods. The setFormat method may be called by a
          Layout to provide advice on how the Message should be formatted. If the Message doesn't recognize the
          format name it will simply format the data using its default format. An example of this is the
          StructuredDataMessage which accepts a format String of "XML" which will cause it to format the event data
          as XML instead of the RFC 5424 format.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <a name="LocalizedMessage"/>
      <subsection name="LocalizedMessage">
        <p>
          <a href="../log4j2-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/LocalizedMessage.html">LocalizedMessage</a>
          is provided primarily to provide compatibility with Log4j 1.x. Generally,
          the best approach to localization is to have the client UI render the events in the client's locale.
        </p>
        <p>
          LocalizedMessage extends a ParameterizedMessage by incorporating a ResourceBundle and allowing
          the message pattern parameter to be the key to the message pattern in the bundle. If no bundle is specified,
          LocalizedMessage will attempt to locate a bundle with the name of the Logger used to log the event. The
          parameters to the Message will be incorporated into the Message whereever the "{}" placeholders occur.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <a name="LoggerNameAwareMessage"/>
      <subsection name="LoggerNameAwareMessage">
        <p>
          LoggerNameAwareMessage is an interface with a setLoggerName method. This method will be called during
          event construction so that the Message has the name of the Logger used to log the event when the
          message is being formatted.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <a name="MapMessage"/>
      <subsection name="MapMessage">
        <p>
          A MapMessage contains a Map of String keys and values. MapMessage implements FormattedMessage and accepts
          a format specifier of "XML", in which case the Map will be formatted as XML. Otherwise, the Map will be
          formatted as "key1=value1 key2=value2...".
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <a name="ObjectMessage"/>
      <subsection name="ObjectMessage">
        <p>
          Formats an Object by calling its toString method.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <a name="ParameterizedMessage"/>
      <subsection name="ParameterizedMessage">
        <p>
          <a href="../log4j2-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/ParameterizedMessage.html">ParameterizedMessage</a>
          handles messages that contain "{}" in the format to represent replaceable tokens and the replacement
          parameters.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <a name="SimpleMessage"/>
      <subsection name="SimpleMessage">
        <p>
          SimpleMessage contains a String that requires no formatting.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <a name="StructuredDataMessage"/>
      <subsection name="StructuredDataMessage">
        <p>
          <a href="../log4j2-api/apidocs/org/apache/logging/log4j/message/StructuredDataMessage.html">StructuredDataMessage</a>
          allows applications to add items to a Map as well as set the id to allow a message to be formatted as a
          Structured Data element in accordance with <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424">RFC 5424</a>.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <a name="ThreadDumpMessage"/>
      <subsection name="ThreadDumpMessage">
        <p>
          A ThreadDumpMessage, if logged, will generate stack traces for all threads. If running on Java 6+ the
          stack traces will include any locks that are held.
        </p>
      </subsection>
      <a name="TimestampMessage"/>
      <subsection name="TimestampMessage">
        <p>
          A TimestampMessage will provide a getTimestamp method that is called during event construction. The
          timestamp in the Message will be used in lieu of the current timestamp.
